			<h2>Lots of Fun </h2>
			<p>Tepia Co was an amazing experience. Everyday we looked forward to coming to the office and making progress with our projects. I highly suggest that future Troy interns consider working here as well. It's a great opportunity to further game and web development skills while having fun. At Tepia Co, we actually had nine interns and six of us developed this website. Two stuck with virtual reality and another has been working on augmented reality. </p>

			<h2>Week 1</h2>
			<p>In our first week, we download everything we needed to start developing games for the Oculus Go. This involved utilizing the correct versions of Android Studio, Unity, and all SDKs, JDKs, and NDKs. Many of us had to uninstall and reinstall several times since we didn't do it correctly the first time and experienced lots of computer crashing. </p>

			<h2>Week 2</h2>
			<p> In our second week, all of us designed and started developing our games. Andy Tran wanted to make a game where you ride on a pirate ship and shoot birds that are flying at you. Irfan Iqbal made an arcade obstacle course. Austin Lee had the idea to make a game where the user shoots objects with a bow and arrow and move around to avoid obstacles. Erin Bhan and Maxim Alayev worked on a game where the player moves around a small planet and dodges asteroids falling from the sky. </p>

			<h2>Week 3</h2>
			<p> On our third week, we decided that we wanted to learn web development. We watched tutorials to learn how to use CSS and HTML to build a website. We got together and developed a general outline of the website and designated tasks for development.</p>

			<h2>Tepia Lifestyle</h2>
			<p> At Tepia Co, the environment is very calm and relaxed. We worked 9:00-5:30 and walked both in and out of the office with smiles on our faces. For lunch there are many places close to Tepia including Chipotle, Blaze Pizza, Chic-fil-a, and HalalGuys.</p>
